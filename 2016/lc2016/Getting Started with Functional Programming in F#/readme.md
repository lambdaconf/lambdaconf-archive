#Getting Started with Functional Programming in F#

Functional programming is one of those things that's only good for math and statistics and stuff right??? Wrong!  In this session we'll start from scratch and code a multi tier application using functional techniques.  Attendees will see F#'s Type Providers which are used to statically type check our data access, and asynchronous data access to help the app scale. This is a live coding talk designed to show unique features of the F# language and how it is directly applicable to solving business problems.


##Running the code

I'll be using Atom with the Ionide plugin. http://ionide.io/

    apm install ionide-installer

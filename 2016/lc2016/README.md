The repository for LambdaConf 2016 USA, containing code samples, presentations, skeleton projects, exercises, papers, and supplementary materials.

# Structure

**All materials should be structured as follows:**

```
/[Talk Name]/...
```

For example, if a talk name is `Elm 101.5`, then your materials should be placed in the directory `/Elm 101.5/`.

For talks or workshops with extremely long, crazy names (Easy-Peasy, **cough**, **cough**), the directory names may be abbreviated. However, the directory names will always **start with** the same names as advertised in the schedule.

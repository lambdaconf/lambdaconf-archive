# Lightning talk: Literate programming with codedown

Codedown is a little utility to extract code blocks from Markdown files.
It can be used to help check the correctness of code in articles and
slideshows, or even to allow Markdown to be the distribution format
for a project's source code.

In this talk, we look at literate programming's roots, how Haskell
provides built-in support for it, and how codedown enables literate
programming in any language.

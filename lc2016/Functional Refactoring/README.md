# Functional Refactoring

Refactoring is one of the important processes in software development.
It's also an accessible opportunity to learn about design patterns
through experimentation.

In this talk, we explore examples of code written in familiar imperative
programming patterns, and refactor each one using a counterpart
functional programming pattern.

Learn how to replace mutable variables with the state monad, loops with
folds, thrown exceptions with sum types, dependency injection with the
reader monad, and much more.  As we go, we will build up a handy
bidirectional map of corresponding imperative and functional patterns.

This talk uses Scala to take advantage of its hybrid object-oriented and
functional design, which caters to both imperative and functional
patterns.

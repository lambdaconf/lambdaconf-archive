            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Julie Moronuki, an author of <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming from First Principles</a>. I have a background in linguistics and philosophy, including logic, and have been a teacher of all levels for nearly 20 years. My mission has always been to make difficult concepts, whether in German philosophy or X-bar syntax, comprehensible to everyone who wants to learn. I am excited to be a guide for the Winter Retreat this year.</p>
<p>I am relatively new to programming, but I came to love Haskell because of the type system and typeclasses and the pervasive monoids.  My developing interests are centered around natural language processing using typed lambda calculus. </p>
<p>My first commitment is, and will remain, teaching. To that end, I am working on several projects to improve the documentation-and-examples situation around Haskell, as well as to make some of the underlying concepts of Haskell more accessible.</p>
<p>I have already had some inquiries about Haskell lessons for relative beginners at the Winter Retreat, something I&#39;d be happy to do. Those lessons could be on foundational concepts (&quot;how do we get from monoids to monads?&quot;) or &quot;how do I make a (fill in the blank) in Haskell?&quot; But I could also plan a workshop on computational semantics! </p>
<p>In other words, I&#39;m here to serve you. What do you want to learn and how can I help you get there?</p>
<p><strong>Please post your suggestions for me below! Vote on ideas by using the thumbs up / thumbs down emojis. Thanks in advance for all of your feedback, and I look forward to being a guide at LambdaConf Winter Retreat 2017!</strong></p>

          <div class="body"><p>I am a beginner Haskell programmer who has read through several books, and am about a third of the way through the Haskell Book. I am attempting to develop an intuition for working with typed languages, but it&#39;s slow going for me. Any Haskell sessions focused on teaching would be helpful for me. Also, if sufficiently geared toward beginners, there would be interest from at least one person learning to program.</p>

<p>Myself, I&#39;d lean more toward NLP using lambda calculus. But I&#39;m most definitely not representative of attendees so don&#39;t consider that. :)</p>

<p>The <code>Applicative</code> and <code>Monad</code> typeclasses allow for function application in the presence of some structure. They are similar in some respects, but they have important differences, differences that are not always well understood. In practice, many people end up using <code>Monad</code> in places where <code>Applicative</code> might be more suitable.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a difference that is perhaps best learned by doing, by using them in real code and comparing what can be done in applicative contexts that cannot be done in monadic contexts, and vice versa. One fun way to do this is through parsing.</p>
<p>We will begin this workshop with a very brief overview of the two typeclasses and a short introduction to parsing in general. We will use two Haskell parsing libraries, <code>optparse-applicative</code> and (probably) <code>trifecta</code>, as we explore the practical differences between applicative and monadic contexts. Finally, we will build a small application using <code>optparse-applicative</code>.  </p>
<p>The workshop will be aimed at people who can read some Haskell syntax and are familiar with the concepts of <code>Applicative</code> and <code>Monad</code>, but might not have much experience using them in practical applications. You do not need to already understand parsing to attend, and you do not need to have ever built a whole project in Haskell. By the end of this workshop, you will have! </p>
<ul>
<li>What language? All code will be in Haskell.   </li>
<li>Who is this for?  People who want to understand <code>Applicative</code> and <code>Monad</code>. People who want to learn more about parser combinators. People who have never built an entire application in Haskell before and want to know how to get started doing that. The second hour or so will be focused on a project that uses the parsing libraries we&#39;ve been exploring and may be of interest even to people who have written programs in Haskell before but have never used <code>optparse-applicative</code>.</li>
<li>Level: Somewhere on the border of <a href="http://lambdaconf.us/downloads/documents/lambdaconf_slfp.pdf">Fire Lubline</a> and <a href="http://lambdaconf.us/downloads/documents/lambdaconf_slfp.pdf">Ice Skrig</a>.</li>

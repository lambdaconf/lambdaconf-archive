            <p>I&#39;m Alejandro Serrano, a PhD student in the area of functional programming, currently working in <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/staff/mena.html">Utrecht University</a>. I use Haskell for my daily job, but I also like to explore what it is out there, especially in the world of logic (like Prolog) and functional-logic programming (like Curry), and in the large space of theorem proving. I am a fierce defendant of strong typing, although some days I wake up and think &quot;if only we could have true Lisp macros in Haskell and ML...&quot;.</p>
<p>I am the author of <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430262503">Beginning Haskell</a> and have worked in enhancing IDEs for the Haskell world as part of <a href="http://serras-haskell-gsoc.blogspot.nl/">two Google Summers of Code</a>. I have developed several open-source libraries, including a <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/t-regex">generalization of regular expressions to arbitrary data types</a> and a <a href="https://git.science.uu.nl/f100183/uchrp/">Constraint Handling Rules engine</a>.</p>
<p>As I said above, I am working on a PhD thesis. The topic: better type error diagnosis for domain-specific languages (aka DSLs). Full story short: we love embedding domain specific languages; they really make programmers more productive. However, when the compiler is not happy with what the user of the DSL wrote, the error message it gets is given in terms of the host language. Thus, we break the abstraction barrier: internals of the DSL leak through error messages, and even worse, the user of the DSL needs to know them to understand error messages. During the past years, my supervisor and I have developed a wide range of techniques for dealing with this problem. If you are interested, you can check my <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/s/Serrano:Alejandro">page at DBLP</a> where all my papers are indexed.</p>
<p>I am happy to present most introductory topics in Haskell, depending on the demand. However, based on my expertise, I would be interested in talking about some of these topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Techniques for embedding DSLs.</strong> There are manu ways to embed a DSL in Haskell. You can create a combinator language. Use a GADT to get a so-called &quot;initial encoding&quot;. Or arrive to the &quot;final encoding&quot; by means of type classes. Meta-programming also gives you a lot of tools. Furthermore, if your DSL has some notion of sequentially, it makes sense to make it a monad, but how: by hand? using a free monad? using an operational monad?</p>
<p>The idea is to explore the wide range of possibilities in this area. We shall focus on how good each choice works in terms of syntax, analizability of the code (so we can optimize or detect errors at compile-time) and flexibility in interpretations (so we can write the code once but execute them on different contexts).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Haskell type system.</strong> As part of my job, I have scrutinized almost all literature related to Haskell (and GHC) type system:</p>
<ul>
<li>The many ways to do polymorphism, from simple parametric polymorphism to higher-rank and impredicative polymorphism.</li>
<li>The initial distinction between types and kinds and how it is blurred by data type promotion and kind-in-kind.</li>
<li>Type classes, and its &quot;functional&quot; counterpart, type and data families.<ul>
<li>The differences between flexible, overlapping, undecidable and incoherent instances.</li>
<li>Functional dependencies and injectivity annotations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extending the language to deal with the local reasoning coming from pattern matching on a GADT.</li>
<li>How to speak of constraints generically, using the <em>Constraint</em> kind.</li>
<li>Boxed and unboxed types and how to write generic functions over those with levity polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can explore together examples of all these features, and argue when and how to use them.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Category Theory in Action.</strong> During LambdaConf 2015 I realized that many people (definitely more than I thought!) is interested in category theory. I am definitely not a category theory expert, but rather a category theory user. We can explore the basic notions of category theory: categories, arrows, functors, natural transformations, monads and adjunctions, always keeping an eye at how these notions translate back to functional programming. (Are instances of the Functor class functors?, this kind of questions).</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to show the power of category theory with two beautiful constructions. One is how to enhance the performance of a monad, almost for free, by using the Yoneda construction. The other one is how to understand a monad as the composition of two adjunctions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very interested in exploring the ideas underlying Common Lisp: macros, multimethods... they seem like a completely different style of programming! Or in a broader sense, the meta-programming facilities found in many languages: Lisp macros, Elixir meta-programming, Template Haskell, MetaOCaml. We can even rethink some of those and hack a small meta-compiler! I am also willing to explore the world of &quot;reactive&quot; libraries, from React-like libraries like ClojureScript&#39;s Om, to Purescript&#39;s Halogen or even .NET Reactive Extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Of course, if you have any other ideas, feel free to comment below! I&#39;m sure we will all have a very enjoyable time at LambdaConf Winter Retreat 2017!</strong></p>

          <div class="body"><p>Since DSLs seem to be something people like and also something different from other guides, I have sketched a small table of contents of such a talk, to see what people think or would like to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an embedded DSL</li>
<li>Simple combinator libraries</li>
<li>The difference between syntax and interpretation: shallow vs. deep embeddings</li>
<li>Initial encodings, including GADT tricks<ul>
<li>Interpretation as a fold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally tagless encoding<ul>
<li>Interpretation as class instance or module implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Computational DSLs using <code>Applicative</code> and <code>Monad</code><ul>
<li>Removing boilerplate using <code>Free</code> and <code>Operational</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encoding binding<ul>
<li>Higher-Order Abstract Syntax</li>
<li>Locally Nameless using the <code>unbound</code> library</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meta-programming: Template Haskell and quasi-quotation</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#39;t know if 2 hours would be enough to cover everything! But everything on the above list is everything I know about embedding DSLs, so it is an upper bound ;)</p>

<p>If @jdegoes finds it OK, we can arrange a room for speaking about Category Theory in the afternoons/evenings a couple of days. Maybe one day we can discuss the basics (category, functor, natural transformations, monads), and the other day look at the topics of the proposed Category Theory in Action (Yoneda for better performance, monad as composition of adjoints). Then people could join either day.</p>

When we speak about &quot;Category Theory&quot;, at what level are we talking about? That would be very helpful in trying to focus the topic.</p>
<p>My current idea is to have a &quot;mini-course&quot; on Category Theory, which should touch at least category, universal constructions (product, sum, terminal and initial objects), functor, natural transformation, adjoint, free-ness, (co-)monads, (co-)algebras, Yoneda lemma. My aim would not be to formally prove all properties, but rather try to discover them by looking at examples in Haskell (and maybe Scala also).</p>
<p>One possibility I discussed with the organizers is to split such a &quot;mini-course&quot; into 4 or 5 small sessions of 30-45 minutes each day, instead of putting everything together into one big talk where people might get lost. What do you think? Any input is welcome :)</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Here is a concrete description of <em>Category Theory Through Functional Programming</em>. Any suggestion is welcome, both in the topics and in the way in which they can be explained.</p>
<h3 id="category-theory-through-functional-programming">Category Theory Through Functional Programming</h3>
<p><strong>Language</strong>: snippets will be presented in Haskell and Scala.</p>
<p><strong>Target Level</strong>: Fire Lubline / Ice Skrig</p>
<p>Functional programming is taking over the world. And with it, categorical thinking is permeating into our code. Notions like functor, monad or free-ness are usual when diving into Haskell or Typelevel Scala. Category theory effectively gives vocabulary for design patterns: the authors of <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/09/the-functor-design-pattern.html">2</a> and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-and-reactive-domain-modeling">3</a> (you should definitely read this book!) make this connection explicit.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of these concepts, it is useful to take a step back and understand the underlying ideas of Category Theory and how they all fit together. Let me be clear: diving into intrincate mathematical theories is not my goal. I want you to understand Category Theory in a practical way, in relation to programming. This relation is two-way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code provides us many examples of categorical structures,</li>
<li>Conversely, in many cases we can implement categorical notions <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Control-Category.html">directly inside our favorite programming language</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, in order to obtain the maximum return for your time investment, you should have an intermediate knowledge of either Haskell or Scala. If you know how to declare a type class or a trait, what a higher-kinded type (or type constructor) is and have ever used a monad, you are ready. Recent versions of the compiler are recommended, for Haskell GHC 8 is the minimum.</p>
<p>Teaching tons of concepts in just one session makes no sense. Ideas need some time to sink before you can effectively build upon them. Thus, our exploration of Category Theory will proceed in daily small pills, of around 45 minutes every day. The (preliminary) list of topics is:</p>
<ol>

          <div class="body"><p>Alejandro, this looks AWESOME. would you recommend attempting to transcribe or implement versions of the code snippets from the talk into Clojure as an exercise? I&#39;m a little more familiar w type theory than I am w category theory so I could be way off in terms of it&#39;s relation to lisps, but i&#39;d be curious for the challenge anyway </p>
